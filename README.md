# How to start the app

In order to run the app you need to run the backend app and the frontend app locally at the same time.

The port for backend is specified in `src/constans/urls.ts`

## How to start the frontend app

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
